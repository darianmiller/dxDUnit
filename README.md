dxDUnit
========

Delphi 5 - Delphi XE+ compatible version of DUnit.  Currently for the Win32 and Win64 platforms.  Initial checkin is from SourceForge revision 26, the last revision that worked with Delphi 5.

Note:  It's time to move beyond Delphi 5 and I am archiving this repository.  It was very useful for me to work with Delphi 5 and DUnit.
